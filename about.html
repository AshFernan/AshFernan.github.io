<p>Logic and conditionals are a metaphor for life because the choices that we chose have consequences that cause  different outcomes, just like the conditional coding the code we plug in has a different outcome due to the condition that is run by. They are both like a fork in a road where each chose leads you down a different road. The logic is the choices in life that are made and on the program it's the code that we plug into the terminal to run. The consequences of life are like the conditions that are written on the conditionals. We all want to choose the correct choice so we could have the best outcome just like the boolean conditions, on it the true condition prints out a value while the false prints out nil.
